              <p>Though my undergraduate studies focused on directing, my passions align strongly with arts administration and community engagement. Currently, I work with The Bushnell in Hartford, CT as Assistant Manager of Producing and Production.</p>

              <p>At The Bushnell, I lead projects across the planning stages, as well as ensure success at various milestones. Budgeting, scheduling, feasibility, engagement, and theatrical production are my strong suits! I am also an on-site manager for The Warner in Torrington, where I am currently assisting with The Bushnell Digital Institute.</p>

              <p>Prior to this, I was The Front of House Operations and Audience Services Manager at University of Hartford. While there, I used knowledge developed by my MBA to increase department revenue by ~$10k and performance attendance by 23% in one year through strategic analysis of patron data and targeted marketing initiatives.</p>

              <p>I have a diverse theatrical background in assistant directing (Hartford Stage, TheaterWorks Hartford), as well as theatrical production and technical roles. I assisted Artistic Director Melia Bensussen on numerous projects, including several regionally accredited plays. I also had the privilege of being mentored by director Cristina Angeles on <em>Queen of Basel</em> (TheaterWorks) and director Tim Golebiewski on <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em> (Eastern Connecticut State University), which was recognized by The Kennedy Center for exceptional ensemble and received merit in several areas of design and directing.</p>

              <p>I have several accredited works, including dramaturgical research for <em>Oedipus the King</em>, which was selected for several research conferences. This work, which involved a 20-page dramaturgical packet, was the LMDA / Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival's Honorable Mention for dramaturgy in 2023. In addition to this, my research "Puppetry as Parody: The Muppets as Remediation and Social Commentary" was selected for presentation at The CREATE Arts Conference.</p>

              <p>Outside of theatre, I enjoy film production and working on independent films with other like-minded creatives. For the last four years, I have been working as an actress, screenwriter, and crew member for independent film company Marsley Films. I have helped produce several independent short films and one feature length title, <em>Spring Cling</em>. This title had a limited screening in Mystic, CT and is available to watch on YouTube.</p>

              <p>When I'm not creating performance pieces, you can catch me listening to pop-punk music, playing the drums, drawing, rewatching The Muppets movies, and planning all my outfits for the week!</p>
