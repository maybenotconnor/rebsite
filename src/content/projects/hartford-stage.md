Showcased here are various tableaus from Hartford Stage projects I assistant directed under Artistic Director Melia Bensussen. Included here are Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale and Romeo & Juliet, the world premiere production of Simona's Search by Martín Zimmerman, and Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. My responsibilities include note taking, assisting with scheduling, tracking blocking, relaying departmental information/concerns, addressing script changes, as well as other various production tasks. Through this process, I learned a lot about professional theater work.
