Spring Cling is an independent long form-film shot across Connecticut. This film follows my character, Becca, as she grapples with graduating college and leaving everything she knows, including her new boyfriend, behind. In addition to acting, I also assisted in writing, producing, and served as costume designer. This film had a limited showing in Mystic, CT.
