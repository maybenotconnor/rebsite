Ethics of a Funeral was a 15-minute play I wrote and directed as a capstone to my undergraduate studies. Outside of writing and directing, I also was able to design elements of the show including lighting and props. The play follows a young woman, Nora, as she arrives to a wake she wasn't invited to. Much to the shock of the one of the attendees, she reveals her long-term affair with the deceased. Haunted by the presence of Patrick, her dead ex-lover, the show explores grief in a comedic way, reflecting on how we glorify even the worst of people in death.
